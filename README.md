# Vulkan-CUDA-TensorRT MNIST Pipeline

## Overview

This project demonstrates a modern GPU-accelerated pipeline that integrates **Vulkan**, **CUDA**, and **NVIDIA TensorRT** for real-time digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The workflow showcases advanced interoperability between graphics and compute APIs, leveraging the strengths of each technology for efficient deep learning inference on the GPU.

## Pipeline Description

### 1. Vulkan Texture Creation

The pipeline begins by creating a texture image using the Vulkan API. Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform 3D graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern GPUs. In this project, Vulkan is responsible for rendering or loading an image into a GPU-resident texture.


### 2. Vulkan-CUDA Interoperability

The Vulkan texture is then shared with CUDA using external memory and semaphore extensions. This enables zero-copy, high-performance data sharing between the graphics and compute domains on the GPU.


### 3. CUDA Image Processing

Once the image is accessible in CUDA, a custom CUDA kernel processes the texture to convert it into the MNIST format (28x28 grayscale, normalized). CUDA is NVIDIAâ€™s parallel computing platform and programming model, enabling direct control over GPU computation.


### 4. TensorRT Inference

The processed image is then passed to NVIDIA TensorRT, a high-performance deep learning inference optimizer and runtime. TensorRT runs a pre-trained MNIST model to recognize the digit in the image, leveraging GPU acceleration for real-time inference.
